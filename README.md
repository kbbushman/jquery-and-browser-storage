# Persisting Form Input with jQuery and Browser Storage

### Objectives
*After this lesson, students will be able to:*

- Create HTML forms and store user input in the browser
- Read and write data with localStorage and sessionStorage
- Understand the pros and cons of using built-in browser storage

### Preparation
*Before this lesson, students should already be able to:*

- Write basic HTML/CSS
- Read and write basic vanilla Javascript

### Why are we doing this?
In this Unit we will be building Browser games with HTML, CSS and client-side JavaScript. Although we are not yet ready to connect a database on the backend or store data on a server, the browser offers the ability to persist data locally using `sessionStorage`, `localStorage` and some other options we may explore later in the course.

Creating a game, you may wish to allow your users to store their names and high scores, or keep track of some other simple data.

[Here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage) is a look at some documentation for the Web Storage API.

## Warm-up
Before we begin, let's look at the files in `browser-storage-examples`
`sessionStorage.html` is the most basic. We will go through this line-by-line in class.
`localStorage1.html` does the same thing, but it adds the clear button.
`localStorage2.html` takes things a bit farther. Take a look at the code and _without opening it in the browser_ see if you can explain what's happening.

Let's brainstorm some other tasks we can accomplish with localStorage or sessionStorage

## Instructions:

- Divide into groups of 3-4
- Figure out something to keep track of on a simple single-page web app
- Build it!


_Remember: `localStorage` and `sessionStorage` only store strings, so you may need to `parseInt()` if you need to do anything with the user data after it has been entered._
